# Virtual Art Gallery – Final Project

Live site: https://your-username.github.io/art-gallery/  
Repo: https://github.com/your-username/art-gallery

hey this is the art gallery thing we threw together for the final  
pulls real paintings from the Art Institute of Chicago – no api key, no rate limits, works every time

## who did what (roughly)

- Madox – random page + artist search page + deployed it  
- Mike – home page, search page, all the css (he’s the reason the cards zoom on hover)  
- Zach – cleaned up the js, fixed bugs, wrote most of this readme and the wireframes

we just used one repo and switched branches when we remembered lol

## what it does

- home – welcome page with a big painting  
- search – type anything (monet, cats, sunflowers…) and get results  
- random – click the button → 9 new random artworks  
- artist – type picasso, van gogh, whoever → see their stuff

looks decent on phones too

├── wireframes/          (four pngs we made in diagrams.net)
└── README.md            (this file)

## how to run it

just open index.html in your browser  
or use Live Server in VS Code – works either way

wireframes are in the wireframes folder like the assignment said

that’s literally it  
hope it works when you check it
